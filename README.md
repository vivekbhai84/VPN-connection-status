#### **Benefits of VPNs:**  
1. **Enhanced Privacy & Security** – Encrypts internet traffic, protecting data from hackers, ISPs, and surveillance.  
2. **Bypass Geo-Restrictions** – Allows access to region-locked content (e.g., streaming services, websites).  
3. **Safe Public Wi-Fi Use** – Secures connections on unsecured networks (e.g., cafes, airports).  
4. **Anonymous Browsing** – Masks IP addresses, making online activity harder to track.  
5. **Avoid Censorship** – Helps users in restrictive countries access blocked websites.  
6. **Secure Remote Work** – Enables employees to safely access company networks from anywhere.  

#### **Limitations of VPNs:**  
1. **Slower Speeds** – Encryption and server distance can reduce internet speed.  
2. **Not 100% Anonymous** – Some VPNs log user data; free VPNs may sell information.  
3. **Blocked by Some Services** – Websites like Netflix and banks may detect and block VPNs.  
4. **Legal & Policy Risks** – VPN use is restricted or illegal in some countries (e.g., China, Russia).  
5. **Complexity for Beginners** – Setting up and choosing a reliable VPN can be confusing.  
6. **Cost of Premium Services** – High-quality VPNs often require a paid subscription.
